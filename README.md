# 9. Exploring Airbnb Market Trends
Apply your importing and cleaning data and data manipulation skills to explore New York City Airbnb data.

New York City has a variety of Airbnb listings to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, with several different price levels, room types, and locations.
Practice your skills in importing and cleaning data and data manipulation and report insights to a real estate start-up! You'll use the datasets `airbnb_price.csv`, `airbnb_room_type.xlsx`, and `airbnb_last_review.tsv` to answer the following questions: 
1. What are the dates of the earliest and most recent reviews?
2. How many of the listings are private rooms?
3. What is the average listing price?

Finally, you'll combine the new variables into one DataFrame called review_dates with four columns in the following order: first_reviewed, last_reviewed, nb_private_rooms, and avg_price.
